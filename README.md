Scripts require Python 3.10

In order to layout the subdirectories ahead of time, each Part # subdir has a .gitignore file in it.  This is the dirty work around the internet suggested.  If you want to use this, then when you add code to the subdir, then please remove the .gitignore file.

### Why Python 3.10?
When I first learned to program, I learned C# first, then C++ (I'm not going to count the time wasted on BASIC).  Those languages supported switch statements for conditional execution.  Python has been lacking switch statements outside of a long elif chain until the release of version 3.10.  I prefer the elegance, readability, and less typing of a switch statement opposed to long chains of elif.
